# 🚀 Smart Service – Local Service Management Platform

## 📌 Project Overview
Smart Service is a Local Service Management Platform (similar to Swiggy for home services) developed as a college project.  
It connects users with local service providers such as electricians, plumbers, cleaners, etc., through a single digital platform.

---
## 🎯 Problem Statement
Finding reliable local service providers is difficult and time-consuming.  
There is no centralized system to:
- Discover nearby service providers
- Book services online
- Track service requests
- Manage services efficiently
